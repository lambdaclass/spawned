# Spawned
Library for concurrent Rust.

# Goals:
- Provide a framework to build robust, scalable and efficient applications in concurrent Rust.
- Set coding guidelines to apply along LambdaClass repositories and codebase.
- Starting point to ideate what we may expect for Concrete runtime implementation.

# Example: hit the ground running
Let's take a look at one of the examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/lambdaclass/spawned/tree/main/examples), the [name server](https://github.com/lambdaclass/spawned/tree/main/examples/name_server).
The name server is a test of the `GenServer` abstraction using `tasks` implementation, and is based on Joe's Armstrong book: Programming Erlang, Second edition, Section 22.1 - The Road to the Generic Server.

We would like to have a server that listens and responds to the following types of messages:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum NameServerInMessage {
    Add { key: String, value: String },
    Find { key: String },
}

#[allow(dead_code)]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum NameServerOutMessage {
    Ok,
    Found { value: String },
    NotFound,
    Error,
}
```

To write our server code, we first need to define the type for our name server's state, and it's handle:
```rust
type NameServerHandle = GenServerHandle<NameServer>;

pub struct NameServer {
    inner: HashMap<String, String>,
}

impl NameServer {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        NameServer {
            inner: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }
}
```

Our name server's API has two async functions: `add`, and `find`, which correspond to the `NameServerInMessage` variants. Note that these map to the return messages' type:

```rust
impl NameServer {
    pub async fn add(server: &mut NameServerHandle, key: String, value: String) -> OutMessage {
        match server.call(InMessage::Add { key, value }).await {
            Ok(_) => OutMessage::Ok,
            Err(_) => OutMessage::Error,
        }
    }

    pub async fn find(server: &mut NameServerHandle, key: String) -> OutMessage {
        server
            .call(InMessage::Find { key })
            .await
            .unwrap_or(OutMessage::Error)
    }
}
```

Now that our base state type is defined, we can implement the `GenServer` trait for our name server. Since the only thing we want to do differently than the defaults is how we handle `call` messages, we implement the async `handle_call` function and it's associated types:
```rust
impl GenServer for NameServer {
    type CallMsg = InMessage;
    type CastMsg = Unused;
    type OutMsg = OutMessage;
    type Error = std::fmt::Error;

    async fn handle_call(
        &mut self,
        message: Self::CallMsg,
        _handle: &NameServerHandle,
    ) -> CallResponse<Self> {
        match message.clone() {
            Self::CallMsg::Add { key, value } => {
                self.inner.insert(key, value);
                CallResponse::Reply(Self::OutMsg::Ok)
            }
            Self::CallMsg::Find { key } => match self.inner.get(&key) {
                Some(result) => {
                    let value = result.to_string();
                    CallResponse::Reply(Self::OutMsg::Found { value })
                }
                None => CallResponse::Reply(Self::OutMsg::NotFound),
            },
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, we can write our `main` function:

```rust
fn main() {
    rt::run(async {
        let mut name_server = NameServer::new().start();

        let result =
            NameServer::add(&mut name_server, "Joe".to_string(), "At Home".to_string()).await;
        tracing::info!("Storing value result: {result:?}");
        assert_eq!(result, NameServerOutMessage::Ok);

        let result = NameServer::find(&mut name_server, "Joe".to_string()).await;
        tracing::info!("Retrieving value result: {result:?}");
        assert_eq!(
            result,
            NameServerOutMessage::Found {
                value: "At Home".to_string()
            }
        );

        let result = NameServer::find(&mut name_server, "Bob".to_string()).await;
        tracing::info!("Retrieving value result: {result:?}");
        assert_eq!(result, NameServerOutMessage::NotFound);
    })
}
```

If you run `cargo run --bin name_server` this should produce:
```
2025-10-17T22:33:41.004784Z  INFO name_server: Storing value result: Ok
2025-10-17T22:33:41.004902Z  INFO name_server: Retrieving value result: Found { value: "At Home" }
2025-10-17T22:33:41.004940Z  INFO name_server: Retrieving value result: NotFound
```

There are many more highlighting other features.

# Rationale

Inspired by Erlang OTP, the main goal for `spawned` is to keep concurrency logic separated from business logic. It provides an actor-model abstraction that honoring Erlang naming we called `GenServer`. `GenServer` handle the concurrency logic, while providing callback functions to implement the business logic.

As stated in  Joe Armstrong's book Programming Erlang:
> The callback had no code for concurrency, no spawn, no send, no receive, and no register. It is pure sequential codeâ€”nothing else. *This means we can write client-server models without understanding anything about the underlying concurrency models.*

This is the most important idea behind `spawned`. You can check [bank](https://github.com/lambdaclass/spawned/tree/main/examples/bank) example that mimics the same example from chapter 22 section 1 of Armstrong's book.

The bottom line is that any project using `spawned` should be simpler and easier to read and maintain, than when not using it. If that's not the case, we are doing it wrong.

# Roadmap

While current version is mostly a PoC, we have ambitious goals:
- Implement a `GenServer` registry. This will allow namimg and accessing `GenServer`s created somewhere else in the code, where the access to the handle is not easily available.
- Implement monitors and supervision trees. A way to manage a tree of actors and provide rules to stop, restart or propagate terminations when a `GenServer` fails.
- Implement our own runtime. Currently we are reexporting tokio structs and traits. We would like to implement our own runtime, probably reusing the bits and parts that we find useful from tokio or other runtimes, as well as implementing our own improvements.
- Implement a deterministic runtime. We think that comonware.xyz's implementation of a deterministic runtime is a great idea, and we plan to do the same or use it in `spawned`.

# Versions:

Two execution versions exist in their own submodules:
- tasks: a runtime is required to run async/await code. The runtime is used in `spawned_rt::tasks` module that abstracts it. (Currently we are using tokio)
- threads: no use of async/await. Just native OS threads code.

While `tasks` version is the one we are testing in other projects, `threads` version is an exploratory work to try to figure out if a tasks based implementation can be imitated by a io::thread implementation with similar behavior. 
Performance comparisons are planned in the future and if we find some scenarios where `threads` version is useful (eg. projects with little or limited number of concurrent threads) we may maintain both, probably behind a feature flag. If we maintain both, the idea is that switching a project from one version to the other should require minimum effort. But currently we are prioritizing `tasks` version so some functionality may not be present in `threads` one.
